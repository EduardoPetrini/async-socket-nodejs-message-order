## Asynchronous Socket Programming in Node.js

### Introduction

Asynchronous socket programming is a technique for writing network applications that can handle multiple requests at the same time. This is achieved by using non-blocking I/O operations, which allow the application to continue processing other requests while waiting for a response from the network.

In this tutorial, we will build a simple asynchronous socket server and client in Node.js. The server will send a series of messages to the client, and the client will process each message as it arrives.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

* Node.js installed on your system
* A text editor or IDE

### Step 1: Create the Server

The first step is to create the server. We will use the `ws` library to create a WebSocket server.

Create a file called `server.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const {WebSocketServer} = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocketServer({
  port: 8080
})
wss.on('connection', function(ws) {
  console.log('connected');

  ws.on('error', console.error);
  ws.on('message', function(data) {
    console.log("Received:", data, typeof (data));
  });

  setTimeout(async ()=>{
    console.log(`Sending message to ${ws._socket.remoteAddress}`);

    for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      const msg = `test_${i}`;
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log(`${msg}: Sending`);
        ws.send(msg);
        ws.send(" ");
        resolve();
      }, 11*Math.random()))
    }

    ws.send('done');
  })
})
```

This code creates a WebSocket server on port 8080. When a client connects to the server, the `connection` event is fired. The `connection` event handler logs the client's IP address and sets up event handlers for the `error` and `message` events.

The `error` event handler simply logs any errors that occur. The `message` event handler logs the message that was received from the
